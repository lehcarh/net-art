    <h1><b>Sublime Space</b></h1>   
    <p>This online exhibition focuses on the primary theme of space and tries to capture the everchanging and infinite size of the universe. 
        All of the featured works are connected through the idea of the sublime or a sensation of greatness that is incomprehensible or could not be imaginable.<br>
    <br>
    The first work made by Neal Agarwal in 2019, <em>The Size of Space</em>, illustrates the vastness of space and how there are stars bigger than our sun and there are galaxies inside of galaxies. 
    Users can experience the size of the solar system, from nebulas to galaxy clusters, through an interactive website.<br>
    <br>
    The exhibition also includes man-made constellations that record the amount of data collected through discussion forums and emails created by Alex Galloway, Mark Tribe, and Martin Wattenberg.
    Although <em>StarryNight</em>, 2019 is limited to a particular discussion list and time period, the end result looks similar to our sky, where the stars are neverending. 
    The constellations are not deliberately formed, but they happen by chance. The clusters of stars form due to users clicking on popular keywords. This natural unfolding reflects the universeâ€™s 
    complex formations of stars, planets, meteoroids, etc.<br>
    <br>
    In continuation of the unknown, the last work, Peter Yumi's <em>The Primordial Moon</em>, 2007 attempts to answer the question of what the moon looked like before the invention of 
    photography. There is a realization that the universe has long existed before humans, and there is still much more we have not discovered. In a billion-year 
    timeline, there are mysteries that we will uncover or even question, like how the moon looked when it was first created.<br>
    <br>
    These three works are mixed media and fairly recent, with the oldest work created in 1999. It includes an interactive website, archive, and photography. 
    The exhibition "Sublime Space" revolves around the infinite, complex, and sublime nature of space.</p>
