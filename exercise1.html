  <p><h1><b>We exist in every moment of yours</b></h1>

<br>
    
Realizing you are the light
I’ve been searching for
We gently flew up
With wings that have lightly spread
Here I am and everything I do is for us
For long-lasting love,
I will freeze my heart
To the future with us
who resemble light
You who grows brighter with every step
Don’t worry if the
Darkness approaches,
I will shine the light
towards you
Our gentle pulse and
shared breaths</p>
