<p>When I was just a kid, I heard him say
  <br>
"When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
  <br>
Think of me if ever you're afraid"</p>  

<p>"One day, you'll leave this world behind
  <br>
So live a life you will remember."</p>

<p>You look at the clock again, which reads 1:11.</p>

<p>The world starts spinning, and your vision becomes blurry until you fade into darkness.
