<p>One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
  <br>
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
  <br>
"When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
  <br>
Think of me if ever you're afraid"</p>  

<p>"One day, you'll leave this world behind
  <br>
So live a life you will remember"</p>

<p>You look at the clock again and it reads 1:11.</p>

<p>The world starts spinning, and your vision becomes blurry until you fade into darkness.</p>
